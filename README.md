# NASA-Asteroid-API

# Description
THis is a project which uses the NASA NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API to fetch data on the nearest asteroids close to earth. The visualization is a simplification with perfect cirular paths but pulls real data of distance, velocity and size of the asteroids.
